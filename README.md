## ArtWorks dApp

Artwork is a marketplace designed for artists to showcase their digital creations as NFTs (non-fungible tokens) and build collections that represent unique sets of their art. 

Artists have the ability to mint their artwork into NFTs directly on the platform, offering an easy way to transform their creations into verifiable and tradable digital assets on the blockchain. Each NFT or collection represents ownership, rarity, and authenticity of the digital art.

Buyers can explore various NFT artworks and collections, offering them the opportunity to purchase and invest in pieces of art, either individually or as part of a curated set. Through this decentralized marketplace, transactions are conducted securely via smart contracts, ensuring trust and transparency
